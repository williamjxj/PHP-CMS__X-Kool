The latest version has been updated to cdat.com/demo. I did the test, they work properly, and still some trivial bugs, display issues, or even structure adjustments.
And the test and applying would be great help for the improvement.

The operation steps:

(1) create sites;
(2) create components;
(3) create modules;
The components are not related to modules; they are both the branches of 'sites'.
(4) Under the modules, create contents;
(5) Under the modules, create resources;
(6) associate 'contents' with 'resources'.
(7) adjust or assign modules/contents/resources whatever the user want.
The resources are not related to contents by default; they are both the branches of 'modules'.
